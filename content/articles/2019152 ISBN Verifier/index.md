The [ISBN-10 verification process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number) is used to validate book identification
numbers. These normally contain dashes and look like: `3-598-21508-8`

## ISBN

The ISBN-10 format is 9 digits (0 to 9) plus one check character (either a digit or an X only). In the case the check character is an X, this represents the value '10'. These may be communicated with or without hyphens, and can be checked for their validity by the following formula:

    (x1 * 10 + x2 * 9 + x3 * 8 + x4 * 7 + x5 * 6 + x6 * 5 + x7 * 4 + x8 * 3 + x9 * 2 + x10 * 1) mod 11 == 0

If the result is 0, then it is a valid ISBN-10, otherwise it is invalid.

## Example

Let's take the ISBN-10 `3-598-21508-8`. We plug it in to the formula, and get:

    (3 * 10 + 5 * 9 + 9 * 8 + 8 * 7 + 2 * 6 + 1 * 5 + 5 * 4 + 0 * 3 + 8 * 2 + 8 * 1) mod 11 == 0

Since the result is 0, this proves that our ISBN is valid.

## Task

Given a string the program should check if the provided string is a valid ISBN-10.
Putting this into place requires some thinking about preprocessing/parsing of the string prior to calculating the check digit for the ISBN.

The program should be able to verify ISBN-10 both with and without separating dashes.

# Testing

To ensure the correctness of your implementation, see [test.sh](test.sh) with usage:

    sh test.sh /path/to/program

It is expected that your program takes as its only argument the ISBN, and exits successfully when it is valid and with exit code 1 when it is not.

# Submission

All submissions must contain a statement that the code is your own work (groups are ok!) and placing the code under either [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), [CC-BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), or [CC-BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).  Submissions are by email to <submissions@badcode.rocks>.  Attaching each source file is preferred, but tarballs or git URLs will also be accepted (especially when directory structure matters).  Submissions may be in any programming language that can be compiled or interpreted on a Debian Stable system.

If relevant, please make it clear what name, pseudonym, or group name you would like your submission attributed to.  This name (and the code content of your submission) will be made public.

Submissions are due by <time datetime="2019-05-31">2019-151 (May 31, 2019)</time> and the winning teardown post will be published the following month.
