The diamond kata takes as its input a letter, and outputs it in a diamond
shape. Given a letter, it prints a diamond starting with 'A', with the
supplied letter at the widest point.

## Requirements

* The first row contains one 'A'.
* The last row contains one 'A'.
* All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.
* All rows have as many trailing spaces as leading spaces. (This might be 0).
* The diamond is horizontally symmetric.
* The diamond is vertically symmetric.
* The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).
* The letters form a diamond shape.
* The top half has the letters in ascending order.
* The bottom half has the letters in descending order.
* The four corners (containing the spaces) are triangles.

## Examples

In the following examples, spaces are indicated by `·` characters.

Diamond for letter 'A':

    A

Diamond for letter 'C':

    ··A··
    ·B·B·
    C···C
    ·B·B·
    ··A··

Diamond for letter 'E':

    ····A····
    ···B·B···
    ··C···C··
    ·D·····D·
    E·······E
    ·D·····D·
    ··C···C··
    ···B·B···
    ····A····

# Testing

To ensure the correctness of your implementation, see [test.sh](test.sh) with usage:

    sh test.sh /path/to/program

It is expected that your program takes as its only argument the letter to generate a diamond for, prints the formatted diamond to STDOUT, and exits successfully.

# Submission

All submissions must contain a statement that the code is your own work (groups are ok!) and placing the code under either [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), [CC-BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), or [CC-BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).  Submissions are by email to <submissions@badcode.rocks>.  Attaching each source file is preferred, but tarballs or git URLs will also be accepted (especially when directory structure matters).  Submissions may be in any programming language that can be compiled or interpreted on a Debian Stable system.

If relevant, please make it clear what name, pseudonym, or group name you would like your submission attributed to.  This name (and the code content of your submission) will be made public.

Submissions are due by <time datetime="2019-03-31">2019-090 (March 31, 2019)</time> and the winning teardown post will be published the following month.
