Thanks everyone who submitted for last month's launch!  All submissions have been tested and posted [to the judges](https://snark.badcode.rocks/archives/2018-October/thread.html) -- watch this space for a tear-down of the winner later this month!  For now, let's keep it moving, with this month's challenge:

Implement, in the worst way possible, a program that outputs the lyrics to the song [99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer).

# Testing

To ensure the correctness of your implementation, see [test.sh](test.sh) with usage:

    sh test.sh /path/to/program

It is expected that your program takes no arguments, and outputs the full lyrics to STDOUT.

# Submission

All submissions must contain a statement that the code is your own work (groups are ok!) and placing the code under either [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), [CC-BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), or [CC-BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).  Submissions are by email to <submissions@badcode.rocks>.  Attaching each source file is preferred, but tarballs or git URLs will also be accepted (especially when directory structure matters).  Submissions may be in any programming language that can be compiled or interpreted on a Debian Stable system.

If relevant, please make it clear what name, pseudonym, or group name you would like your submission attributed to.  This name (and the code content of your submission) will be made public.

Submissions are due by <time datetime="2018-11-30">2018-334 (October 30, 2018)</time> and the winning teardown post will be published the following month.
