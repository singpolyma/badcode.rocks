# Pig Latin

Implement, in the worst way possible, a program that translates from English to Pig Latin.

Pig Latin is a made-up children's language that's intended to be
confusing. It obeys a few simple rules (below), but when it's spoken
quickly it's really difficult for non-children (and non-native speakers)
to understand.

- **Rule 1**: If a word begins with a vowel sound, add an "ay" sound to the end of the word. Please note that "xr" and "yt" at the beginning of a word make vowel sounds (e.g. "xray" -> "xrayay", "yttria" -> "yttriaay").
- **Rule 2**: If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the end of the word and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word. Consonant sounds can be made up of multiple consonants, a.k.a. a consonant cluster (e.g. "chair" -> "airchay").
- **Rule 3**: If a word starts with a consonant sound followed by "qu", move it to the end of the word, and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word (e.g. "square" -> "aresquay").
- **Rule 4**: If a word contains a "y" after a consonant cluster or as the second letter in a two letter word it makes a vowel sound (e.g. "rhythm" -> "ythmrhay", "my" -> "ymay").

There are a few more rules for edge cases, and there are regional
variants too.

See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_latin> for more details.

# Testing

To ensure the correctness of your implementation, see [test.sh](test.sh) with usage:

    sh test.sh /path/to/program

It is expected that your program takes an English word or phrase as the only command line argument, and outputs the Pig Latin equivalent to STDOUT.

# Submission

All submissions must contain a statement that the code is your own work (groups are ok!) and placing the code under either [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), [CC-BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), or [CC-BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).  Submissions are by email to <submissions@badcode.rocks>.  Attaching each source file is preferred, but tarballs or git URLs will also be accepted (especially when directory structure matters).  Submissions may be in any programming language that can be compiled or interpreted on a Debian Stable system.

If relevant, please make it clear what name, pseudonym, or group name you would like your submission attributed to.  This name (and the code content of your submission) will be made public.

Submissions are due by INSERT DATE and the winning teardown post will be published the following month.
